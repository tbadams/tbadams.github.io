I am also interested in databases, User Experience and web design.  I additionally have a background in classical and electronic music and am particularly passionate about the intersection of music and technology.\r\n\r\n###Thesis\r\nFor my graduate thesis, I contributed to the open source project App Inventor for Android by designing and implementing a component enabling the creation of music-making applications.  The project required knowledge of the Supercollider synthesis library, Android SDK, Android Native Development Kit (NDK) and Java Native Interface (JNI).  I also designed and implemented scalability improving functionality that loads native libraries and assets based on application needs.\r\n\r\nThe first part of my change has been accepted, and the second is being submitted for review.\r\n\r\n[Thesis Code Part 1](https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/commit/6b43a06f5d27f21fa3df846aa6f569169ea79b31)\r\n\r\nThesis Code Part 2: In Review\r\n\r\n[Thesis Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j-YHekIxQAB8A8tNDBAxzdDQgqa1M8xxTgMhjsSsy8w/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\n[Resume](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18h8N0Vfa5uVfDKibnSri89nPO8hcAM0isOmn0MSl7R4/edit?usp=sharing)  \r\n\r\n[Github Profile](https://github.com/tbadams)\r\n\r\n[LinkedIn Profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/trevoradams)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
